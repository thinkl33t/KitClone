Software for making 'backups' for model planes / acrylic robots / anything that is made from a series of pieces of sheet stock glued together.

The idea is to scan in your parts before building the model.  At this point, the software will convert your model to a series of simple vectors, and output an SVG file that can then be cut out on a laser cutter / CNC mill.
